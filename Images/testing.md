The following SQL skills and concepts will be covered in this Case Study :

1.  Learning how to interpret ERDs (entity-relationship diagrams) for data literacy and business context 

-   Identify key columns of interest and how they are linked to other tables via foreign keys
-   Use ERDs to analyze the data types for different columns in database tables
-   Understand data context for various tables that cause inherent natural relationships between fields

2.  Introduction to all types of table joining operations

-   Simple joins: left, inner
-   More involved joins: cross, anti, left-semi, full outer
-   Combination set operations: union, union all, intersect, except

3.  Practical application of table joins

-   Joining multiple tables to combine disparate datasets into a single data structure
-   Joining interim SQL outputs for more advanced group-by, split, merge data hacking strategies
-   Performing table joins that use 2 or more table references in the  `ON`  condition
-   Using anti joins to exclude records in a sequential fashion

4.  Filtering, window functions and aggregates for analytics and ranking

-   Using  `ROW_NUMBER`  to effecively rank order records with equal ties
-   Using  `WHERE`  filters to extract ranked records
-   Using multiple aggregate functions with different target partitions and ordering expressions for efficient data analysis
-   Using aggregate group by clauses to generate unique customer level insights

5.  Case statements for data transformation and manipulation

-   Pivoting datasets from long to wide using  `MAX`  and  `CASE WHEN`
-   Manipulating actual data values using conditional logic for business translation purposes

6.  SQL scripting basics

-   Designing SQL workflows which can be easily understood and implemented
-   Managing multiple dependencies for downstream table joining operations by using temporary tables to store interim datasets

7.  Manipulating text data

-   Converting text columns to title case
-   Combining multiple text and numeric data type columns into a single text expression
