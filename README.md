![enter image description here](https://github.com/mohammedsaqlainattar/Serious-SQL-Apprenticeship/blob/main/Images/Data%20with%20Danny.png?raw=true) 


Serious SQL is a virtual data internship/apprenticeship program by **Danny Ma** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/)). You can find the course [here](https://www.datawithdanny.com/courses/serious-sql).

I'm using **Docker** as the containerization platform to setup my computing environment and all the databases are stored here.

I'm also using **PostgreSQL** as the SQL flavour for all excercises and projects in this repository.
